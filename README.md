# ZigDocsHtml

Currently, generated documentation for Zig (including `std`) takes the form of a SPA, parsing a library's source code and rendering documentation within the client. This prevents indexing by search engines and makes LLMs ignorant of Zig's standard library.

This repository is used to host Zig documentation as static files. It is formatted similarly to normal docgen. It's a bit janky, but hopefully better than nothing at all.
