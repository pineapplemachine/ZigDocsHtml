An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions.
An example is using a broadcast address for sendto without broadcast permission being set using setsockopt(SO.BROADCAST).
Another possible reason for the WSAEACCES error is that when the bind function is called (on Windows NT 4.0 with SP4 and later), another application, service, or kernel mode driver is bound to the same address with exclusive access.
Such exclusive access is a new feature of Windows NT 4.0 with SP4 and later, and is implemented by using the SO.EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE option.</p>

The system detected an invalid pointer address in attempting to use a pointer argument of a call.
This error occurs if an application passes an invalid pointer value, or if the length of the buffer is too small.
For instance, if the length of an argument, which is a sockaddr structure, is smaller than the sizeof(sockaddr).</p>
</div></div><div><pre><code>WSAEINVAL = <span class="tok-number">10022</span></code></pre><div class="fieldDocs"><p>Invalid argument.
Some invalid argument was supplied (for example, specifying an invalid level to the setsockopt function).
In some instances, it also refers to the current state of the socket—for instance, calling accept on a socket that is not listening.</p>
</div></div><div><pre><code>WSAEMFILE = <span class="tok-number">10024</span></code></pre><div class="fieldDocs"><p>Too many open files.

This error is returned from operations on nonblocking sockets that cannot be completed immediately, for example recv when no data is queued to be read from the socket.
It is a nonfatal error, and the operation should be retried later.
It is normal for WSAEWOULDBLOCK to be reported as the result from calling connect on a nonblocking SOCK.STREAM socket, since some time must elapse for the connection to be established.</p>
</div></div><div><pre><code>WSAEINPROGRESS = <span class="tok-number">10036</span></code></pre><div class="fieldDocs"><p>Operation now in progress.
A blocking operation is currently executing.
Windows Sockets only allows a single blocking operation—per- task or thread—to be outstanding, and if any other function call is made (whether or not it references that or any other socket) the function fails with the WSAEINPROGRESS error.</p>
</div></div><div><pre><code>WSAEALREADY = <span class="tok-number">10037</span></code></pre><div class="fieldDocs"><p>Operation already in progress.
An operation was attempted on a nonblocking socket with an operation already in progress—that is, calling connect a second time on a nonblocking socket that is already connecting, or canceling an asynchronous request (WSAAsyncGetXbyY) that has already been canceled or completed.</p>
</div></div><div><pre><code>WSAENOTSOCK = <span class="tok-number">10038</span></code></pre><div class="fieldDocs"><p>Socket operation on nonsocket.
An operation was attempted on something that is not a socket.

</div></div><div><pre><code>WSAEDESTADDRREQ = <span class="tok-number">10039</span></code></pre><div class="fieldDocs"><p>Destination address required.
A required address was omitted from an operation on a socket.
For example, this error is returned if sendto is called with the remote address of ADDR_ANY.</p>
</div></div><div><pre><code>WSAEMSGSIZE = <span class="tok-number">10040</span></code></pre><div class="fieldDocs"><p>Message too long.
A message sent on a datagram socket was larger than the internal message buffer or some other network limit, or the buffer used to receive a datagram was smaller than the datagram itself.</p>
</div></div><div><pre><code>WSAEPROTOTYPE = <span class="tok-number">10041</span></code></pre><div class="fieldDocs"><p>Protocol wrong type for socket.
A protocol was specified in the socket function call that does not support the semantics of the socket type requested.
For example, the ARPA Internet UDP protocol cannot be specified with a socket type of SOCK.STREAM.</p>
</div></div><div><pre><code>WSAENOPROTOOPT = <span class="tok-number">10042</span></code></pre><div class="fieldDocs"><p>Bad protocol option.

The requested protocol has not been configured into the system, or no implementation for it exists.
For example, a socket call requests a SOCK.DGRAM socket, but specifies a stream protocol.</p>
</div></div><div><pre><code>WSAESOCKTNOSUPPORT = <span class="tok-number">10044</span></code></pre><div class="fieldDocs"><p>Socket type not supported.
The support for the specified socket type does not exist in this address family.

</div></div><div><pre><code>WSAEOPNOTSUPP = <span class="tok-number">10045</span></code></pre><div class="fieldDocs"><p>Operation not supported.
The attempted operation is not supported for the type of object referenced.

</div></div><div><pre><code>WSAEPFNOSUPPORT = <span class="tok-number">10046</span></code></pre><div class="fieldDocs"><p>Protocol family not supported.
The protocol family has not been configured into the system or no implementation for it exists.
This message has a slightly different meaning from WSAEAFNOSUPPORT.
However, it is interchangeable in most cases, and all Windows Sockets functions that return one of these messages also specify WSAEAFNOSUPPORT.</p>
</div></div><div><pre><code>WSAEAFNOSUPPORT = <span class="tok-number">10047</span></code></pre><div class="fieldDocs"><p>Address family not supported by protocol family.
An address incompatible with the requested protocol was used.
All sockets are created with an associated address family (that is, AF.INET for Internet Protocols) and a generic protocol type (that is, SOCK.STREAM).
This error is returned if an incorrect protocol is explicitly requested in the socket call, or if an address of the wrong family is used for a socket, for example, in sendto.</p>
</div></div><div><pre><code>WSAEADDRINUSE = <span class="tok-number">10048</span></code></pre><div class="fieldDocs"><p>Address already in use.
Typically, only one usage of each socket address (protocol/IP address/port) is permitted.
This error occurs if an application attempts to bind a socket to an IP address/port that has already been used for an existing socket, or a socket that was not closed properly, or one that is still in the process of closing.
For server applications that need to bind multiple sockets to the same port number, consider using setsockopt (SO.REUSEADDR).
Client applications usually need not call bind at all—connect chooses an unused port automatically.
When bind is called with a wildcard address (involving ADDR_ANY), a WSAEADDRINUSE error could be delayed until the specific address is committed.
This could happen with a call to another function later, including connect, listen, WSAConnect, or WSAJoinLeaf.</p>
</div></div><div><pre><code>WSAEADDRNOTAVAIL = <span class="tok-number">10049</span></code></pre><div class="fieldDocs"><p>Cannot assign requested address.
The requested address is not valid in its context.
This normally results from an attempt to bind to an address that is not valid for the local computer.
This can also result from connect, sendto, WSAConnect, WSAJoinLeaf, or WSASendTo when the remote address or port is not valid for a remote computer (for example, address or port 0).</p>
</div></div><div><pre><code>WSAENETDOWN = <span class="tok-number">10050</span></code></pre><div class="fieldDocs"><p>Network is down.
A socket operation encountered a dead network.
This could indicate a serious failure of the network system (that is, the protocol stack that the Windows Sockets DLL runs over), the network interface, or the local network itself.</p>
</div></div><div><pre><code>WSAENETUNREACH = <span class="tok-number">10051</span></code></pre><div class="fieldDocs"><p>Network is unreachable.
A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network.

The connection has been broken due to keep-alive activity detecting a failure while the operation was in progress.

</div></div><div><pre><code>WSAECONNABORTED = <span class="tok-number">10053</span></code></pre><div class="fieldDocs"><p>Software caused connection abort.
An established connection was aborted by the software in your host computer, possibly due to a data transmission time-out or protocol error.</p>
</div></div><div><pre><code>WSAECONNRESET = <span class="tok-number">10054</span></code></pre><div class="fieldDocs"><p>Connection reset by peer.
An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.
This normally results if the peer application on the remote host is suddenly stopped, the host is rebooted, the host or remote network interface is disabled, or the remote host uses a hard close (see setsockopt for more information on the SO.LINGER option on the remote socket).
This error may also result if a connection was broken due to keep-alive activity detecting a failure while one or more operations are in progress.
Operations that were in progress fail with WSAENETRESET. Subsequent operations fail with WSAECONNRESET.</p>
</div></div><div><pre><code>WSAENOBUFS = <span class="tok-number">10055</span></code></pre><div class="fieldDocs"><p>No buffer space available.

</div></div><div><pre><code>WSAEISCONN = <span class="tok-number">10056</span></code></pre><div class="fieldDocs"><p>Socket is already connected.
A connect request was made on an already-connected socket.
Some implementations also return this error if sendto is called on a connected SOCK.DGRAM socket (for SOCK.STREAM sockets, the to parameter in sendto is ignored) although other implementations treat this as a legal occurrence.</p>
</div></div><div><pre><code>WSAENOTCONN = <span class="tok-number">10057</span></code></pre><div class="fieldDocs"><p>Socket is not connected.
A request to send or receive data was disallowed because the socket is not connected and (when sending on a datagram socket using sendto) no address was supplied.
Any other type of operation might also return this error—for example, setsockopt setting SO.KEEPALIVE if the connection has been reset.</p>
</div></div><div><pre><code>WSAESHUTDOWN = <span class="tok-number">10058</span></code></pre><div class="fieldDocs"><p>Cannot send after socket shutdown.
A request to send or receive data was disallowed because the socket had already been shut down in that direction with a previous shutdown call.
By calling shutdown a partial close of a socket is requested, which is a signal that sending or receiving, or both have been discontinued.</p>
